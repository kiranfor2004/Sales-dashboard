# Sales Dashboard

This project is a simple sales dashboard that visualizes sales data. It consists of a Python Flask backend and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setup and Running

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Frontend

1.  Open the `frontend/index.html` file in a web browser.

The dashboard will display a bar chart showing the total retail sales by item type.
